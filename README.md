# Hi there, Renato here, nice to meet you!

## A little bit about me

I am a social data scientist and political economist with a strong focus on data visualisation design. I have years of experience in academia, media, think tanks, research institutions and international organisations.

I learned R in 2019 and fell in love with programming. Nowadays I mostly use **R, Python, SQL** and visualisation tools, but I love to explore and find creative solutions or ideas on how to communicate messages with a clear and convincing argument.

### What's in My Toolkit?

- 📊 **Visualizing the Unseen**: Transforming complex data into compelling visual stories.
- 🔍 **Data Detective**: Diving deep into data for illuminating insights.
- 🌐 **Multilingual Maven**: Communicating across cultures and languages with ease.
- 📈 **Research Renaissance**: From numbers to narratives, I weave data into impactful stories.
- 🌿 **Eco-Digital Maverick**: At the intersection of environmental policy and digitalization.

### Why GitHub? 
I think github is the best place to develop ideas and let programming flourish with creativity. It makes me happy to see so many talented programmers around and motivates me to improve and be aware of how rich this world is. On my personal page you will find a colourful range of projects, from climate policy analysis to visual explorations of social trends. I am also available as a freelance consultant.

### Let's Connect!
Got an idea that combines data with a bold narrative? I'm all ears! Whether you're a data enthusiast, a policy wonk or just someone who loves a good chart, I'm open to doing something new.
